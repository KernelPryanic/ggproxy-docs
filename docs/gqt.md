# GraphQL Template Language

The GraphQL Template Language (GQT) is an [open source](https://github.com/graph-guard/gqt) template language developed by the GraphGuard team specifically for GraphGuard Proxy to allow for intuitive and flexible definitions of GraphQL query templates. GQT closely resembles the structure of query, mutation and subscription operations.
